# -Document-Scanning-with-Python

A Python-based tool to transform photos of documents into clean, scanned-like images using libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and Skimage. This project automates image preprocessing, contour detection, and perspective correction, providing high-quality document scans from raw images.

Features

Image Preprocessing: Grayscale conversion, Gaussian blurring, and edge detection.
Contour Detection: Identifies document boundaries in images.
Perspective Correction: Warps the document to a flat, straightened view.
Visualization: Before-and-after image comparison for better insights.

Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
NumPy
Skimage
Matplotlib
